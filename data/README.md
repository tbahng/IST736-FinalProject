# IST736-FinalProject

This is a dedicated folder for data.

The objective of the project is to use the main skills taught in this class to solve a real text mining problem.

Define a problem on the dataset as a classification and/or clustering problem, and 
describe it in terms of its real-world organizational or business application. 
This investigation must include some aspects of experimental comparison: depending on 
the problem, you may choose to experiment with different types of algorithms or 
techniques, e.g. different types of classifiers, and some experiments with tuning parameters 
of the algorithms. Alternatively, if your problem is suitable, you may use more than one of the algorithms 
(Clustering + Classification, e.g.). Some explanation is needed to justify your choice of algorithms.
