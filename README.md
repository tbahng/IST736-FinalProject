The objective of the project is to use the main skills taught in this class to solve a real text mining problem.

Define a problem on the dataset as a classification and/or clustering problem, and describe it in 
terms of its real-world organizational or business application. This investigation must include some 
aspects of experimental comparison: depending on the problem, you may choose to experiment with 
different types of algorithms or techniques, e.g. different types of classifiers, and some experiments with tuning
parameters of the algorithms. Alternatively, if your problem is suitable, you may use more than one of 
the algorithms (Clustering + Classification, e.g.). Some explanation is needed to justify your choice of algorithms.
